# Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Analysis
This repository Contains Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis Assignments solutions using Python.

## Details

1. Assignment01: 
   * Implement a function that takes a vector of numbers as an input and outputs the values needed to plot the boxplot. Specifically, the function should output the 1st quartile (q1), 2nd quartile (q2), 3rd quartile (q3), the inter-quartile range, a vector containing the outlier points and the vector containing the extreme outlier points.<br><br>
2. Assignment02:
   * Implement a function to verify the Central Limit Theorem using throwing a die example.<br><br>
3. Assignment03: 
   * Implement a function that computes the p-value to test the hypothesis that the mean of one dataset is equal to the mean of another dataset. The function should take as inputs the two datasets and the significance level, and outputs the p-value. The significance level is 0.05.<br><br>
4. Assignment04:
   * Fishers Linear Discriminant Implementation from scratch.<br><br>
5. Assignment05:
   * Implementation of a simple & multiple linear regression model from scratch.<br><br>
6. Assignment06:
   * Implementation of Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm from scratch.
